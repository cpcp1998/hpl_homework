1st implementation:
Sequential complexity: O(n^3)
Parallel communication complexity: O(p*n^2)
Isoefficiency function: n^3 >= C*p*n^2 ---> n >= C*p
Scalability: M(C)/p = C^2*p

2nd implementation:
Sequential complexity: O(n^3)
Parallel communication complexity: O(p*p*n*sqrt(n))
Isoefficiency function: n^3 >= C*p^2*n*sqrt(n) ---> n >= (C*p^2)^(2/3)
Scalability: M((C*p^2)^(2/3))/p = C^(4/3)*p^(5/3)

The first implementation is more scalable
